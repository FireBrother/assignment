'' </s> <s> administration officials now acknowledge that when nato failed to live up to its earlier threat in june to strike serbia , milosevic took advantage of the indecision and plunged ahead with an artillery and tank offensive against the lightly armed guerrilla forces , whose bedrock of popular support had helped win them effective control of large swaths of kosovo territory , including key roads . </s> <s> while he was doing that , milosevic skillfully managed a key requirement for washington : he made sure that the war did not spill over into neighboring albania and macedonia , fragile countries in a traditionally volatile area . </s> <s> all along , the biggest fear in washington has been that the kosovo conflict would engulf neighboring countries and encourage albania and the ethnic albanian population in macedonia to join the cause . </s> <s> such a possibility raised the specter of a new balkans conflict just three years after peace was secured in bosnia . </s> <s> milosevic catered to washington 's concern that the conflict be contained . </s> <s> the yugoslav army mined kosovo 's borders with macedonia and albania , ensuring that few refugees could escape and limiting routes for arms supplies for the rebels . </s> <s> the yugoslav leader also understood that washington was unsure about how to deal with the disorganized albanian political leadership in kosovo and the unbending kosovo liberation army , whose main chiefs were hardened emigres returned from switzerland and germany . </s> <s> for example , holbrooke persuaded milosevic to meet in may with ibrahim rugova , the top albanian political leader in kosovo , an encounter that turned out to be little more than a photo opportunity . </s> <s> for that procedural breakthrough , holbrooke recommended the lifting of a ban on foreign investment in serbia that had been put in place the month before . </s> <s> after meeting with rugova , milosevic stepped up his military operations in kosovo , forcing washington to reverse itself again and carry out the investment ban . </s> <s> in late june , holbrooke met with two self-styled kosovo guerrilla commanders in the province 's western town of junik but then broke off all contact . </s> <s> clinton administration officials said at the time that they were concerned that nato intervention would bolster the separatist forces . </s> <s> to try to put the best face on the situation , washington worked with moscow to get milosevic to accept the presence of international monitors who would patrol kosovo and report on military action . </s> <s> the monitors were slow in getting organized . </s> <s> by august , when the yugoslav army , backed by the serbian special police , were in full swing against the rebels and burning and looting villages in the process , the monitors found it difficult to gain access to the fighting . </s> <s> they drove up to roadblocks , knew something was going on from the sounds and the smoke , but could not be precise . </s> <s> in recent days as the tanks and artillery have withdrawn , access has improved , the monitors say . </s> <s> but there are some areas in central kosovo around likovac and gornje obrinje that the monitors have ruled off limits because of land mines on the roads . </s> <s> the mines are believed to have been planted by the guerrillas . </s> <s> gornje obrinje was the site of a massacre of 18 ethnic albanian women , children and elderly people on sept. 26 . </s> <s> a british reporter who walked across fields into the village on sunday said about 10 mortar shells , apparently from the serbian police or the yugoslav army , were fired at the village early sunday afternoon . </s> <s> the yugoslav army and police forces have been responsible for the vast majority of atrocities in the kosovo conflict , said a report by new york-based group human rights watch , released here on sunday . </s> <s> the report said the rebels had also violated the laws of war by taking civilian hostages and carrying out summary executions . </s> <s> but the violations by the guerrillas were on a `` lesser scale '' than the government abuses , the author of the report , fred abrahams , concluded . </s> <s> the report focused on what it called a watershed in the conflict _ the attack by police forces on three ethnic albanian villages in late february and early march in the drenica region of central kosovo . </s> <s> at least 83 people , including 24 women and children , were killed in the attack , which involved helicopters , artillery and armored personnel carriers . </s> <s> in the yugoslav capital , belgrade , which is a four-hour drive north through rolling countryside from kosovo 's capital of pristina , milosevic remains politically secure . </s> <s> that is in part , his domestic critics say , because diplomats like holbrooke and the head of the u.n.refugee agency , sadako ogata , insist on going to see him , thus enhancing his stature . </s> </p> </d>",

'' </s> <s> likewise , when red cross representatives this year tested the water supply at the 840 hospitals and clinics where they operate , they found that not one had water that was suitable for human consumption , said sten swedlund , head of the red cross delegation in north korea . </s> <s> `` but of course they drink it _ they have no choice , '' he said during a recent trip to beijing . </s> <s> `` there is a very close relationship between the problems caused by the lack of food and a health sector that 's in very bad shape .

'' </s> <s> although the north koreans date their food problems to a series of floods and droughts in the mid-1990 's , the foreign researchers who have worked in north korea say medical records and childhood growth patterns indicate that the hunger began several years before that and is linked to the collapse of the soviet union , which had long been north korea 's main supplier of food , fuel and fertilizer . </s> <s> north korea is a mountainous country , with less than 20 percent arable land . </s> <s> it has been a food importer for decades , mostly from the former soviet union , but also from china . </s> <s> `` the country has to come to grips with the fact that this is part of a structural problem and ca n't just be blamed on the weather anymore , '' ms. cheng-hopkins said . </s> <s> still , she and others praised the normally rigid and secretive government for slowly loosening its restrictions . </s> <s> swedlund said that after three years in the country , the international red cross , which collaborates with the north korean red cross , had found officials increasingly responsive and doctors more willing to share medical records and bring up problems . </s> <s> travel is still restricted . </s> <s> there are more than 100 counties , home to 30 percent of the population , to which aid groups have no access and where they have therefore refused to provide food or medical supplies . </s> <s> still , the number of counties open to the workers has increased steadily , and freedom to move about has improved . </s> <s> ms. cheng-hopkins said about half of follow-up inspections were now unannounced , and she noted that the researchers in the nutritional survey were allowed to select villages to visit and enter homes at random . </s> <s> workers from the red cross and the world food program said they had not observed extreme scenes of people dying of acute starvation and believe that they would have if they were occurring frequently . </s> <s> `` i have not seen acute starvation like i have seen in bangladesh , '' dr. katona-apte said . </s> <s> `` but that does n't mean it ca n't exist . </s> <s> we 're still really limited in what we can see . '' </s> <s> swedlund said it was unlikely that the counties still closed to foreigners were markedly different from the open ones . </s> <s> and while some have surmised that the closed counties might harbor pockets of death and devastation , he said he accepted north korea 's explanation that they had been excluded from some areas for national security reasons . </s> <s> `` one thing i 've learned is how important national security issues are to the north koreans , '' said swedlund , a retired admiral in the swedish navy . </s> <s> `` and i really think these areas are important from that standpoint , '' he added , going through a map of closed areas and describing what western intelligence experts know about military installations there . </s> <s> he also rejected the notion that the north korean military is stealing donated food , a charge leveled by the organization doctors without borders , when it angrily pulled out of north korea last summer to protest the many restrictions on groups working there . </s> <s> now that aid groups say they are starting to get somewhat better cooperation from the north koreans , they hope to repeat their nutrition survey every 6 to 12 months . </s> <s> and they are still analyzing some tantalizing findings : boys were twice as likely to suffer from stunted growth as girls , and every child whose mother was dead was malnourished . </s> <s> `` a generation of north korean children is already scarred for life , '' said astrid heiberg , president of the international federation of red cross and red crescent societies , in an interview in beijing after a trip to north korea . </s> <s> `` we need to continue to mobilize resources to prevent an even greater catastrophe .

        "data": "<d> <p> <s> the commerce department on tuesday provided a concrete measure of the effects of the global economic downturn on the american economy , reporting that the nation 's trade deficit widened by $ 2.2 billion in august to $ 16.77 billion . </s> <s> that is the widest gap since the government recalculated the way it measures trade flows in 1992 . </s> <s> it resulted from a decline in american exports and a sharp increase in what this country buys from abroad . </s> <s> so far this year , the trade deficit is running roughly 50 percent above last year 's levels and is up to a projected $ 170 billion for the year , a gap that is expected to widen even further . </s> <s> one senior administration official who deals with economic issues , speaking on condition of anonymity , said tuesday that internal projections suggest that the trade deficit in 1999 could reach $ 300 billion , a figure that he said `` will certainly cut into growth , and could well become a major political problem . '' </s> <s> trade deficits carry with them both good and troubling signals about the economy . </s> <s> the current flood of imports is helping contain inflation to some of the lowest levels in decades . </s> <s> and while sales of american aircraft , computer chips and other goods are suffering , the weakening of the dollar on world markets in recent weeks may provide an end-of-the-year boost for american exporters . </s> <s> but at this moment of global upheaval , the biggest problem facing american companies is the inability of many nations and some large companies in asia and latin america simply to borrow money to make ordinary purchases . </s> <s> the result is such a freeze of economic activity that empty shipping containers are stacking up on american piers . </s> <s> and the effects are hurting everyone from midwest farmers who can no longer send wheat to an impoverished russia , to east coast fishermen who are discovering that japan 's appetite for salmon and lobster has been ruined by the banking crisis . </s> <s> among the most surprising elements of tuesday 's report is that more than a third of august 's deficit was with one country that so far has managed to ward off the worst effects of the global troubles : china . </s> <s> despite continued growth of the chinese economy , exports to china have slowed dramatically and imports of chinese-made goods have exploded , as the country desperately seeks to sell here goods that would ordinarily be sold elsewhere in asia . </s> <s> that increased the monthly deficit with beijing to $ 5.9 billion , levels previously only seen in trade with japan . </s> <s> the chinese _ besieged by floods , deeply troubled state-owned industries and an incipient banking crisis _ have signaled to the united states in recent weeks that they have little interest in any swift moves to open their markets further in return for entry into the world trade organization . </s> <s> that amounts to a major setback for president clinton , who for three years has been using the negotiations over china 's entry to the world body as the centerpiece of his effort to open china both economically and politically . </s> <s> ostensible progress in this area has been cited by the administration until recently as one of the successes of the administration 's china policy , but now officials say privately that the progress is evaporating . </s> <s> the decline in exports will trim the growth of the american economy , and it was one factor in the federal reserve 's decision to lower interest rates two times in recent weeks . </s> <s> so administration officials were going out of their way tuesday to portray the numbers as another warning sign , but not a crisis . </s> <s> `` while the united states remains strong and sound , the troubled condition of the global marketplace continue to strongly influence the u.s. trade balance , '' commerce secretary williams daley said in a statement tuesday . </s> <s> after china , the biggest deterioration in the american trade balance in august came in mexico , where the peso has weakened markedly as economic contagion has spread through latin america . </s> <s> exports to mexico have remained unchanged . </s> <s> but imports from mexico have increased markedly _ chiefly automobiles and automotive parts and telecommunications equipment _ as american manufacturers have taken advantage of the weakening currency . </s> <s> in contrast , america 's trade surplus with brazil , the latest focus of concern by the administration and the international monetary fund , barely budged from the same period a year ago . </s> <s> normally , that would be cited as a sign of continued demand for american products in latin america 's largest economy , but there is fear it might be imperiled . </s> <s> the news comes as the united states and the imf complete a bailout package of $ 30 billion or more for brazil , intended to help it stave off the kind of economic troubles that have swept through asia , russia and several other nations . </s> <s> tuesday the imf and brazil reached agreement on the country 's fiscal targets for this year and next , a sign that the aid will likely be announced after elections in brazil this weekend . </s> <s> but for all these potential problems , the rising trade deficit has barely caused a ripple on capitol hill . </s> <s> because the rising level of imports does not appear to be triggering any unemployment here , the subject has barely come up in races for the house and senate around the country . </s> <s> the only exception has been in regions where the steel industry is strong . </s> <s> the major steel companies have charged in recent weeks that asian nations are dumping products on the american market at prices well below their costs . </s> <s> the commerce department has begun an inquiry . </s> <s> the commerce department 's numbers showed that the deficit rose 15.3 percent to $ 16.77 billion in august , up from a revised figure of $ 14.55 billion in july . </s> <s> the department said that the resumption of production at general motors corp. after last summer 's strike may have increased the size of the deficit 's rise in august , as gm brought in parts from abroad . </s> <s> the deficit was the highest since the commerce department began a new method of tracking trade information in 1992 . </s> <s> exports , the department said , fell three tenths of 1 percent , to about $ 74.8 billion . </s> <s> imports rose 2.2 percent to $ 91.6 billion . </s> </p> </d>",

'' </s> <s> of the 34 senate seats in play , 18 are held by democrats and 16 by republicans , who now hold 55 seats in all . </s> <s> republicans would have to win 28 of the 34 races to produce the 67 votes necessary for conviction , assuming such a vote were to go along party lines . </s> <s> only an electoral catastrophe for the democrats , which seems almost unthinkable , could produce such a huge loss . </s> <s> jennifer duffy , who follows senate races for the cook political report , a nonpartisan newsletter , said that so far , at least , none of the senate candidates has made an explicit appeal for votes based on how they would vote on a presidential jury . </s> <s> but she and others are wondering if this may be about to change . </s> <s> this is difficult ground to measure . </s> <s> one of the central questions of this political year has been how clinton 's dealings with ms. lewinsky might affect turnout . </s> <s> for a long time , politicians assumed that dispirited democrats would stay home as a rebuke to clinton , just as many republicans did in november 1974 , three months after president richard m. nixon resigned . </s> <s> but now some analysts wonder if the partisan fight in congress last week might have the opposite effect among some democrats . </s> <s> `` that 's the problem , '' said stuart rothenberg , the editor of an independent political newsletter in washington . </s> <s> `` it 's not that we do n't know , and that the politicians do n't know , where the general public stands on impeachment . </s> <s> the problem is that we do n't know where the electorate stands on impeachment . '' </s> <s> and asking voters to think ahead to an impeachment proceeding as they cast their ballots in a senate race is , in the words of stuart stevens , a republican consultant , `` a double bank-shot . '' </s> <s> such strategies , he said , tend to work only with a small number of single-minded or sophisticated voters . </s> <s> against that complicated backdrop , the prevailing thinking is that the use of the impeachment issue will vary from race to race , state to state and week to week , depending on the circumstances of the candidates and the composition of the electorate . </s> <s> if democrats try to turn the image of clinton in the dock to their advantage , it would be in states with a democratic edge or with sizable numbers of black voters , who overwhelmingly support the president . </s> <s> in contests like those , it might well prove to be in the interest of a democratic candidate to , as one consultant put it , sit down in front of a camera and tape an advertisement in which the candidate denounces the president 's behavior but solemnly pledges to vote against impeachment . </s> <s> strategists in both parties believe that kind of approach could prove effective . </s> <s> `` this is an issue where there is a huge disconnect between the elites and the public , '' said fred yang , a democratic consultant with clients in wisconsin and the carolinas . </s> <s> that kind of democratic strategy might emerge in california , new york , illinois , wisconsin , washington and perhaps arkansas . </s> <s> by contrast , democrats in south carolina , georgia and nevada would be less likely to oppose clinton 's impeachment . </s> <s> on the other side , republican consultants are telling their candidates to stress clinton 's misdeeds and stay away from talk of impeachment . </s> <s> the last thing the party wants is to turn the senate elections into a referendum on whether clinton should be forced from office . </s> <s> `` the white house might think from the overall public numbers that maybe they would like to make this a referendum election , '' said ed goeas , a republican pollster who is working in senate races this year . </s> <s> `` republicans certainly are n't going to let that happen . '' </s> <s> d'amato responded to questions about clinton with the language that republican consultants have been suggesting to their candidates . </s> <s> `` when and if that matter comes to the senate , i will decide on the facts that are presented to me at that time , '' d'amato said . </s> <s> `` it would be very premature for me to suggest any course of action without it being referred . </s> <s> because , indeed , we may be called upon to act as a jury of some kind . '' </s> <s> but schumer , a member of the house judiciary committee , which is conducting the impeachment investigation , virtually embraced the issue . </s> <s> in a live telecast of the hearings , he said the president deserved a lesser punishment , such as censure or reprimand . </s> <s> and schumer plans to campaign in new york on monday with clinton at his side . </s> <s> schumer 's media adviser , hank morris , seemed to suggest last week that impeachment will grow as an issue . </s> <s> `` senator d'amato claims he does not want to share his opinion with the people of new york , '' morris said . </s> <s> `` and if he does n't have an opinion , he 's the only new yorker who does n't have an opinion .

re-election , are intensely lobbying the group to try to shift its support to the democratic challenger , rep. charles schumer . </s> <s> publicly , officials in the organization , the human rights campaign , said they were still deliberating their position in the closely watched race , considered among the tightest in the nation . </s> <s> they said they would probably make an endorsement by friday . </s> <s> but privately , organization officials and gay activists from both parties who have been monitoring the debate say the group is most likely to endorse d'amato , a republican seeking his fourth term . </s> <s> they also raised the possibility that the group would endorse both candidates , or remain neutral . </s> <s> if the group endorses d'amato , said officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity , the endorsement would be based on three major factors : the group tends to favor incumbents , has been searching for allies among the senate republican majority and considers d'amato 's recent record on gay issues to be quite strong . </s> <s> an endorsement by the group , which is held in high regard by many gay and lesbian voters , could prove important in swinging voters to d'amato in a tight race . </s> <s> it would also be a major symbolic victory for the senator , who has sought to recast himself as a centrist in recent years and could use the endorsement to build his standing among moderate swing voters . </s> <s> a d'amato endorsement would also weaken schumer 's efforts to portray the incumbent as a right-wing extremist and would signify to many voters a fraying of the traditional democratic coalition that has included black and gay voters , women and labor unions . </s> <s> the intensity of the debate surrounding the endorsement underscores the importance of the new york senate race to democrats across the nation , who see defeating d'amato as one of their best opportunities to prevent the republicans from gaining 60 seats in the senate _ enough to stop a democratic filibuster . </s> <s> the republicans currently hold a 55-to-45 majority . </s> <s> `` there is sentiment in the community that if the republicans get 60 votes , that trent lott will basically be in charge politically for the next two years , '' said david mixner , a close friend of president clinton 's who is gay . </s> <s> he was referring to the senate majority leader , who has called homosexuality a sin and likened it to kleptomania . </s> <s> saturday , schumer picked up his own endorsement from new york 's largest gay and lesbian political organization , the empire state pride agenda . </s> <s> although the human rights campaign is bipartisan , it has been very close to the clinton administration , has many democrats on its board and receives much of its money from democratic contributors . </s> <s> largely because of the group 's strong democratic ties , gay democrats , new york liberals and white house officials are infuriated that it is even considering endorsing d'amato , who also runs on the right to life and conservative party lines and often receives high ratings from the christian coalition , which typically opposes legislation on civil rights for gay people . </s> <s> although the organization has been thought to be inching toward a d'amato endorsement for months , the lobbying campaign for schumer has picked up intensity in the last two weeks , driven partly by a growing sense that the race is now closer than ever . </s> <s> democrats and advocates in both parties who support rights for gay people said that vice president al gore , hillary rodham clinton and secretary for health and human services donna shalala have made personal appeals to human rights campaign officials urging them not to endorse d'amato . </s> <s> white house officials said they did not know whether the three had made such appeals , and human rights campaign officials declined to comment . </s> <s> schumer met privately with the group 's top officials last week to make one last pitch for the endorsement . </s> <s> clinton administration officials have also been buttonholing the group 's board members at every opportunity , from cocktail parties to fund-raisers , raising concerns about a d'amato endorsement . </s> <s> some new york advocates of civil rights for gay people have flooded the organization with phone calls , e-mail messages and letters . </s> <s> democratic officials have been encouraging the group 's major donors to express their opposition to d'amato . </s> <s> people involved in the lobbying efforts said that at best , they are hoping the group will endorse both candidates , or make no endorsement at all . </s> <s> `` chuck schumer has been a strong supporter of issues that are important to gay communities , '' said a senior white house official who spoke on the condition of anonymity . </s> <s> `` the last thing that they should want to do is hurt the candidacy of someone who has been so supportive of their agenda . '' </s> <s> the human rights campaign is considered the most influential gay and lesbian organization in washington , with a national membership of 250,000 and an annual budget of more than $ 13 million . </s> <s> the group was created in the early 1980s in large part to counter the rise of the christian right and ronald reagan . </s> <s> paradoxically , d'amato was first elected in the reagan landslide of 1980 and remained a strong supporter of president reagan . </s> <s> for d'amato , who has aggressively courted gay voters , the endorsement would represent a crowning achievement in his efforts to reposition himself as a moderate . </s> <s> since 1993 , the senator has backed the right of gay citizens to serve in the military , sponsored legislation to prevent job discrimination against gay workers and opposed his own leadership 's attempts to block the nominations of two openly gay men to positions in the clinton administration . </s> <s> to gay supporters of d'amato , an endorsement by the human rights campaign would signify the political maturation of the gay electorate and help the organization insulate itself from accusations that it is too close to the democratic party . </s> <s> those who support a d'amato endorsement , including top officials within the human rights campaign , contend that in the current political climate , where congress is almost certain to remain under republican control after november , gay people must build alliances with moderate republicans . </s> <s> human rights campaign officials also say their standing policy is to support friendly incumbents , even when their challengers have better voting records on gay issues . </s> <s> that is the case in new york , where schumer 's rating by the human rights campaign has been consistently better than d'amato 's . </s> <s> both men , however , have angered advocates of rights for gay people by voting for legislation that allows states to not recognize gay marriages . </s> <s> in a precedent widely cited by d'amato supporters , the organization endorsed sen. john f. kerry , a democrat , over the republican challenger , william weld , in the 1996 massachusetts senate race , even though weld 's record on gay rights was considered stronger . </s> <s> the move angered gay republicans , who now contend that snubbing d'amato would prove that the group is biased toward democrats . </s> <s> but there is clearly a large number of human rights campaign contributors and board members who strongly feel that endorsing d'amato will permanently damage the group , particularly among women . </s> <s> they fear that abortion rights supporters will quit the group in droves because d'amato has never wavered in his opposition to abortion during 18 years in congress . </s> <s> many new york gay activists would also be deeply upset if the group endorses d'amato , whom they blame for installing the state senate majority leader , joseph bruno , whom they consider to be strongly anti-gay . </s> <s> matt foreman , executive director of the empire state pride agenda , cited d'amato 's role as `` the architect '' of the state republican party as a major reason the group endorsed schumer . </s> <s> `` while he has criticized fellow republicans in washington for their intolerance , here at home , his own party 's blatant discrimination is still the order of the day , '' foreman said . </s> <s> for that reason , some white house officials say they think a human rights campaign endorsement of d'amato will be almost meaningless among gay voters . </s> <s> they contend that it might even hurt the senator among his conservative base . </s> <s> `` i do n't think anybody will vote for al d'amato because of an hrc endorsement , '' said a white house aide who spoke on the condition of anonymity . </s> <s> `` but i think some people in the right to life party and some upstate people are going to say , `who is this guy and why should we vote for him ?

'' </s> <s> by july 1994 , microsoft had become quite interested in the spyglass technology , colbeth says , and the two companies signed their first licensing agreement the following december . </s> <s> microsoft , colbeth recalls , always told him that it would eventually fold browser technology into its operating system , but its timing was accelerated by netscape 's rapid rise . </s> <s> `` microsoft was initially hoping to charge for the browser , '' colbeth said . </s> <s> but on dec. 7 , 1995 , gates declared that microsoft would not only deeply integrate its browser into windows but would give it away . </s> <s> the announcement caught the industry , even colbeth , by surprise . </s> <s> at the time , spyglass had licensed its technology to 82 other companies , including ibm and digital equipment , for use in their software products _ a licensing revenue stream of about $ 20 million a year . </s> <s> as a result of microsoft 's move , spyglass saw those revenues vanish within a year , as smaller internet software companies went out of business and big customers shifted to microsoft 's free browser . </s> <s> spyglass slashed its payroll and scrambled into new niches of the software industry to replace its lost sales , which it succeeded in doing eventually . </s> <s> `` whenever you license technology to microsoft , you have to understand it can someday build it itself , drop it into the operating system and put you out of that business , '' colbeth said . </s> <s> the nonoption compaq : suddenly sees the light well into 1996 , netscape 's share of the browser market continued to rise , while microsoft made little headway , even though its browser was free . </s> <s> industry analysts and trade magazines agreed that netscape 's browser was the clear technical leader . </s> <s> in april 1996 , netscape 's navigator was used by 87 percent of people browsing the web , compared with 4 percent using microsoft 's internet explorer , according to zona research . </s> <s> so the biggest personal computer maker , compaq , thought it made sense to give customers netscape 's browser instead of microsoft 's . </s> <s> but microsoft would not stand for that _ and compaq had no choice but to give in . </s> <s> in june 1996 , compaq wanted not only to load the more popular netscape browser on its machines but also to remove the icon for microsoft 's internet explorer , which was delivered to the computer maker with windows 95 . </s> <s> microsoft informed compaq that if it removed internet explorer , the computer maker would lose its license for windows , said stephen decker , compaq 's director of software procurement , in testimony to federal investigators . </s> <s> the ultimatum from microsoft was delivered bluntly in a letter headed , `` notice of intent to terminate license agreement .

'' </s> <s> noting that a compaq executive is a witness for microsoft , herbold said , `` we are totally dependent on tremendous relationships with key companies like compaq . '' </s> <s> at netscape , however , the compaq episode was a watershed . </s> <s> `` that was the singular act that got me going to the justice department , '' barksdale recalled . </s> <s> barksdale said he regarded microsoft 's tactic of forcing compaq to buy its browser as a condition of obtaining an essential product , the windows operating system , as `` an illegal act and absolute proof that microsoft was a monopolist . '' </s> <s> after investigating the incident , the justice department and the states agreed with barksdale that microsoft was illegally tying the sale of one product to another . </s> <s> microsoft replies that it has a long history of adding new features to its operating system . </s> <s> and from the outset , microsoft says , it intended that windows and its internet explorer browser would be seamlessly integrated , as they are now in windows 98 . </s> <s> thus , microsoft insists , there is no product-tying violation of antitrust laws . </s> <s> in a separate case , a federal appeals court sided with microsoft , upholding the principle that the company could put whatever it wanted to in its operating system and declare it a single product . </s> <s> but in june 1996 , when compaq wanted to offer the netscape product instead of microsoft 's browser , most industry experts viewed the browser and operating system as two different software programs . </s> <s> `` it took a long time for the integration strategy to play out , '' said a former senior microsoft researcher . </s> <s> `` back then , integration was basically bolting a browser onto windows .

'' </s> <s> his point , shared widely among economists , is that some tying benefits consumers if , for example , it results in products that are easier to use or enables a company to recover development costs . </s> <s> but tying can be bad if it locks in monopoly power . </s> <s> the courts , white says , have not offered enough guidance for distinguishing good tying from bad , which is the nub of the legal dispute . </s> <s> microsoft says it needs only to show that bundling windows and explorer passes what might be called a `` gross '' consumer benefits test _ that it offers an immediate benefit , whether or not it causes long-term damage to competition and , therefore , ultimately to consumers . </s> <s> the justice department says that microsoft 's practices must clear a higher hurdle : yielding `` net '' consumer benefits that are immediate and large enough to balance possible long-term harm to competition . </s> <s> so which test of consumer benefits satisfies antitrust laws ? </s> <s> the simple answer is that no one knows for sure , which is why both sides can reasonably cite the same cases without fear of embarrassment . </s> <s> consider a 1985 case , aspen skiing co. vs. aspen highlands skiing corp. , and a 1951 case , lorain journal co. vs. united states . </s> <s> in the first , aspen skiing , the owner of three major ski runs in aspen , colo. _ the monopolist _ had for years sold a ticket in cooperation with aspen highlands , a competitor , that gave skiers access to both companies ' runs . </s> <s> when aspen skiing unilaterally canceled the agreement , its rival 's revenues shriveled and the rival sued . </s> <s> the supreme court ruled that aspen skiing had violated antitrust laws because there was no evidence its action helped consumers . </s> <s> in the lorain journal case , the only local newspaper in lorain , ohio , refused to sell advertising to companies that advertised on a new radio station . </s> <s> here , too , the supreme court ruled that the exclusionary practice did nothing to benefit consumers . </s> <s> indeed , in aspen skiing , the court even forced the monopolist to do business with its rival , a precedent that augurs well for the justice department , which seeks to force microsoft to install netscape 's browser alongside its own . </s> <s> but charles rule , a legal consultant to microsoft , says that in both cases the courts threw out exclusionary practices only because they offered no consumer benefit . </s> <s> the courts , he argues , never pounced on practices that resulted in lower prices or better products or service . </s> <s> nor did the courts in either case call for balancing immediate benefits against hypothetical long-term harm . </s> <s> rule argues that microsoft 's practices produce demonstrable consumer benefits . </s> <s> besides , he says , unlike the actions taken by the lorain journal or aspen skiing , microsoft 's contracts do not prevent consumers from installing netscape 's browser or from using the web sites of microsoft 's rivals . </s> <s> in truth , though , neither case answered what consumer benefit test should apply to product design . </s> <s> in jefferson parish hospital district no . </s> <s> 2 et al . </s> <s> vs. hyde , another case cited by both sides , the supreme court in 1984 recognized that surgeons and anesthesiologists provide an integrated service . </s> <s> yet , the court said , a hospital with monopoly power would still not be allowed to force surgical patients to use its panel of anesthesiologists if consumers wanted to purchase the two services separately . </s> <s> that principle could undercut microsoft 's defense that the functional interdependence of windows and explorer requires bundling . </s> <s> but microsoft will point to a strong concurring opinion that called for a tougher standard for the government to meet when it alleges tying . </s> <s> microsoft will also draw support from several court rulings that allowed ibm to change the design of its computers in ways that made it hard for vendors to attach peripheral equipment . </s> <s> but perhaps microsoft 's best argument is that nowhere has the government identified a single case in which the courts explicitly called for throwing out a tied product on the basis of a balancing test . </s> <s> the courts , microsoft will emphasize , steer clear of redesigning technically sophisticated products . </s> <s> the justice department 's rejoinder is to note that the sole purpose of antitrust law is to protect consumers , so it makes no sense to bless practices that provide a dollar 's worth of benefits today but , by stamping out competition , drive prices up by $ 1,000 tomorrow . </s> <s> the justice department will ask the court to at least insist that monopolists use the least exclusionary means possible to achieve whatever services they provide customers . </s> <s> experts agree that the courts will subject microsoft 's restrictive contracts with internet companies to a balancing test . </s> <s> but exactly how the court will decide whether consumers are helped or hurt is up for grabs . </s> <s> a balancing test would have the courts weigh the immediate benefits to consumers of one-click access to internet sites and of features of a bundled windows-explorer package versus the harm over time of diminished competition in the markets for browsers and operating systems . </s> <s> but a test that makes good sense in theory can prove fiendishly difficult to use in practice . </s> <s> `` balancing tests are impossibly difficult and arbitrary , '' said rep. thomas campbell , r-calif. , who is a former law professor at stanford university . </s> <s> `` the practical effect of balancing is to hand defendants like microsoft almost certain victory .

'' </s> <s> and in fact , in 1993 the commission voted 2-2 on the question of whether to file formal charges . </s> <s> the deadlock served as a dismissal . </s> <s> then , a few months later , the justice department decided to pick up the case . </s> <s> `` it was farther along than most cases we got , '' recalled robert litan , a former senior official in the justice department 's antitrust division who is now at the brookings institution . </s> <s> `` usually a case would be two or three people complaining and a few documents , '' he said . </s> <s> `` but this was a fully researched record . </s> <s> they gave us the files and briefed us on what they had done . '' </s> <s> the justice department lawyers picked up the same thread . </s> <s> `` the general idea behind our inquiry , '' litan said , `` was that they should not be allowed to use their monopoly in operating systems to cement a monopoly in other areas . '' </s> <s> in 1995 , microsoft and the government reached a consent agreement in which the company promised to stop forcing pc makers to buy one copy of a microsoft operating system for every computer sold _ instead of one for every computer on which the operating system , ms-dos or windows , was installed . </s> <s> the company also agreed to stop tying the sale of one software product to the sale of another . </s> <s> the charges in the present suit are similar in many ways . </s> <s> even with the agreement , the government investigations continued . </s> <s> that same year , justice department investigators showed up at the offices of netscape communications corp. for the first time to ask questions about their next line of inquiry . </s> <s> `` america online had been complaining , '' a senior netscape executive recalled , `` because microsoft was bundling the microsoft network , '' a competing online service , `` with windows . '' </s> <s> once more , market forces overtook the investigation . </s> <s> the microsoft network never grew particularly popular while america online prospered and grew . </s> <s> but , not surprisingly , new complaints filled the void . </s> <s> in may 1995 , anne bingaman , the assistant attorney general who headed the antitrust division , remarked : `` we get complaints about microsoft all the time . </s> <s> we have become a kind of microsoft complaints center . </s> <s> and we take them very seriously . '' </s> <s> in 1996 , netscape 's first complaint arrived . </s> <s> in a letter to the justice department , netscape said that microsoft was using its dominance in personal-computer operating systems to force or persuade computer makers to favor microsoft 's browser , used to explore the world wide web , over the one marketed by netscape . </s> <s> the next year the justice department formally charged microsoft with violating the consent agreement by tying sales of windows to installation of the company 's web browser on new computers . </s> <s> `` it seemed like a slam-dunk violation of the consent decree , '' a natural extension of that case , recalled litan , who had left the department by then . </s> <s> a federal district court judge agreed , but an appeals court panel overturned that ruling this summer . </s> <s> in the meantime , last may the justice department and 20 state attorneys general filed their new suit against microsoft , which is scheduled for trial on monday . </s> <s> it contends that microsoft has engaged in bundling , tying and other predatory behavior similar in many ways to the numerous previous allegations and investigations of the last nine years . </s> <s> `` a good part of this case is just round ii of the case we dealt with in round i , '' in the early in the 1990s , litan said . </s> <s> or , as the former senior ftc official put it , `` there 's certainly a common thread that runs all the way through here .
