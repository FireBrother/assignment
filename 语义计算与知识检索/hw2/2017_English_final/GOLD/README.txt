LIST OF VERSIONS

  v1.0 [2015/11/15]: initial distribution of the data


SUMMARY

The data enclosed is a compilation of all annotated sentiment datasets for the five 2017 tasks. 
It is divided by utility for a particular subtask in 2017:

A: Message Polarity Classification
B: Topic-Based Message Polarity Classification, two-point scale
C: Topic-Based Message Polarity Classification, five-pont scale
D: Topic-Based Tweet quantification, two-point scale
E: Topic-Based Tweet quantification, five-point scale

Each file includes the year and type (dev/test/train) of download to refer to the collection from prior SemEval runs of this task: in 2013-2016.

Summary of the subtasks:

Subtask A: Message Polarity Classification.
Given a message, classify whether the message is of positive, negative, or neutral sentiment.

Subtasks B-C: Topic-Based Message Polarity Classification.
Given a message and a topic, classify the message on
B) two-point scale: positive or negative sentiment towards that topic
C) five-point scale: sentiment conveyed by that tweet towards the topic on a five-point scale.

Subtasks D-E: Tweet quantification.
Given a set of tweets about a given topic, estimate the distribution (i.e., %) of the tweets across
D) two-point scale: the "Positive" and "Negative" classes
E) five-point scale: the five classes of a five-point scale.

NOTES

1. Please note that by downloading the Twitter data you agree to abide by the Twitter terms of service (https://twitter.com/tos), and in particular you agree not to redistribute the data and to delete tweets that are marked deleted in the future.

2. The distribution consists of a set of Twitter status IDs with annotations for Subtasks A, B, C, D, and E: topic polarity and trends toward a topic. You should use the downloading script to obtain the corresponding tweets:

3. The "neutral" label in the annotations stands for objective_OR_neutral.

4. Even though we provide a default split of the data from previous years into training, development and development-time testing datasets, participants are free to use this data in any way they find useful when training and tuning their systems, e.g., use a different split, perform cross-validation, train on all datasets, etc.

5. Unlike in previous years, for SemEval-2017 Task 4, there will be no progress testing, and thus all the provided data can be used for training and development.

6. The 2015 data for subtasks B and D is on a three-point scale. The "neutral" class should be ignored for that data.

7. The naming of the subtasks is based on the SemEval-2017 Task 4 naming; it might not exactly match the naming in previous years.

8. In Subtask A, there are 665 duplicate annotations across and within the files. We kept them in the file to preserve the dataset to prior years. We strongly encourage you to remove these duplicates when you train and test your system.
