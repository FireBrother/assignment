632237370314784768	dustin johnson	-1	@Chris__Shield @kizrees at least Dustin Johnson knows how to party which is why I'm guessing he falls apart by Sunday after his weekend out
622972681797902336	dustin johnson	-1	"@KellyTilghmanGC  After the 2nd round, you did your usual melodramatic spew that Dustin Johnson was in a class of his own. Same old garbage."
622843555069960192	dustin johnson	-1	After 75 today maybe I was wrong about Dustin Johnson getting over US Open collapse. Terrible 3rd RD #OpenChampionship
632057945908379657	dustin johnson	-1	"Also, I see Dustin Johnson is leading after the 1st round of a major again. So he's gonna choke on the weekend again? #boring"

631949057783693312	dustin johnson	-1	Can you bet on Dustin Johnson to be top five all week until Sunday when he comes 6th and below? I'd take that...
631906897285763072	dustin johnson	-1	Did anyone tell Dustin Johnson that winning requires a lead on the 4th day and not just the 1st day?
633043669365485568	dustin johnson	-1	Dustin Johnson and Sunday's just don't mesh well #PGAChampionship
622854721066397696	dustin johnson	-1	Dustin Johnson dealt with another major disappointment after shooting +3 &amp; going from leading after 2 at -10 to being tied for 22nd &amp; at -7

633019212718600192	dustin johnson	-1	Dustin Johnson is just a walking disaster on Sunday's lately.
632984693600878593	dustin johnson	-1	"Dustin Johnson isn't the first guy to drop 22 places in a major on Sunday, but it usually takes more than 1 hole. #PGAChampionship"

632984249751089152	dustin johnson	-1	Dustin Johnson just took an 8 on the 1st hole. I don't feel so bad about my golf game suddenly. #PGAChampionship #snowman
631873949488418816	dustin johnson	-1	Dustin Johnson leading the #PGAChampionship ...until the 3rd round of course when he naturally falls apart.
631849429398589440	dustin johnson	-1	Dustin Johnson off to a flyer yet again! All he needs to do is stay off the coke on Saturday night.
622828874024550400	dustin johnson	-1	"Dustin Johnson shot the 2nd worst round of anybody in the field on a day where literally almost every player was under par, just awful"

681049869990125568	kendrick	-1	@Phoenvvx sure. Even Kendrick lost it towards the end of his Black Friday freestyle ( and this isn't me hating).

678691412628647937	kendrick	-1	How cam called obj over to him was just as disrespectful when Kendrick called out Cole 1st and last name on control and not everybody else

641020845759045633	murray	1	4th set point in this game and  challenge called in. Anderson 2-0 sets. Murray much more promising at the end of the 2nd. He's not out yet!

641035681842774016	murray	1	@BrainGameTennis If Murray takes 3rd set I think he'll win
641010499447091200	murray	1	@DareToHart i'm not a huge fan myself but you know Murray will probably comeback in the 3rd &amp; 4th set knowing him.

640359691646799874	murray	1	@ScottSFTC I wish I had seen your picks earlier after the day I had!!! Murray won 3-0 so your 2nd pick didn't hit. GL

640368066237464576	murray	1	@usopen Ofcourse! Looking forward to Murray's 4th round game against the big-serving Anderson. A potential 5-setter. #usopen #nightshift
641018469081841664	murray	1	A good  hold from Murray. 5-3 in 2nd. How is Anderson's head coping with this now?
640342271682998273	murray	1	A lot has happened while I was away sprain-spraying my ankle. Murray has taken the 1st set 6-3 in 50 mins &amp; is up a break at 2-1 in the 2nd.

641022355809153025	murray	1	Anderson takes a toilet break. He's up 2 sets but doesn't really have the momentum. Murray finished 2nd set stronger.
640339076068077568	murray	1	Assuming Murray pulls it out here all 4 matches on Monday will be very intriguing.
640359085750255616	murray	1	Bellucci played a great 3rd set but Murray was just too good. He advances into week 2 with a comfortable 6-3 6-2 7-5 win #TeamMurray #usopen

640594196093665280	murray	1	Mr. Murray gave me some really great life advice in the 7th grade and I was too much of a little douchebag to appreciate it.
640347551875645441	murray	1	"Murray 6-3 6-2. First set 50mins, 2nd 34. Bellucci's fine start, belief, fading fast, Murray steady with flashes of his best, like SP pass."

641026431955275776	murray	1	Murray gets the break he needed. Even's things in the 3rd. Anderson has 3 sets to fail if Murray hopes to win.
640990648301056000	murray	1	Murray has decided to only hit Aces. Already 4 and it's just his 2nd game !!
641013183562555396	murray	1	Murray has this. He may not have it at the moment but I'm not worried #USOpen #murray

638610739884900352	nicki	-1	@MileyCyrus I dreamed about katy perry dragging Nicki's back for you on sunday and it was very fatal. I hope it's gonna happen
638426362014003200	nicki	-1	"@Nicki_F @ThalesLives @scottedelman You may disagree Nicki, but the facts just don't support you. Nor does the vote by all of fandom."
638467839867813888	nicki	-1	@TMZ Miley may act and be the way she is but she is a good person. Nicki is the one looking for fights anywhere. Embarrassing...
638213295313453056	nicki	-1	"@itsbl0ndie I still think it was fake. I always thought Nicki to be the type to call you out on a random Tuesday, not at an awards show"

638200075571851264	nicki	-1	"@nice_feminist she may be a """"""""problematic fave"""""""" but there's NO reason for her to be getting dragged just cuz Nicki said some shit"
638543287457050624	nicki	-1	@rayshellbox Kasi nga diba may prejudice pa rin about black entertainers? Also Miley says that Nicki keeps pulling the race card--

638215640306839552	nicki	-1	"And tomorrow Nicki is going to be seen as ""a raging angry black women"" for calling Miley out of something that she is GUILTY for"
638238764238659584	nicki	-1	Do you guys remember that not too long ago Nicki was like one of the most hated artist.. During her Pink Friday album
638400941306327040	nicki	-1	"I think Nicki made an ass out of herself last night. 1st you call the VMA's racist, 2nd then you perform and accept an award at the VMA's"
638181134413656064	nicki	-1	I'm over here tryna do this work before classes start tomorrow and Nicki is being the shady bitch queen she is and I just lost all focus

638193301951238144	nicki	-1	If you think Nicki's ass is more than 1/8th real you are fuuucked
638181130026512384	nicki	-1	Kanye and Nicki are the reason they may have to do away with award shows. YOU say it's about artists but you two always make it about YOU.
638163651766038528	nicki	-1	"Literally 1st time I've ever watched the #VMAs. Miley called Nicki out on her CRAP, and I respect that. #sorrynotsorry #suckitupnicki"

623984383691591680	sharknado	-1	"Sharknado 3 Oh Hell No, is that the movies title or just everyone's reaction when they heard a 3rd one was being churned out?"

624431022713778180	sharknado	-2	It may be significant to some of those who enjoy movies with a cult following but Sharknado is a disgrace to the film industry

624040969915252736	sharknado	-2	Sharknado was funny the first time. We humored them for the 2nd. But a THIRD? Even I'm not enough of a fan of bad movies to watch that shit.
