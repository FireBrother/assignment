638599370590527488	barca	1	@halamufc @swagattt @joelsimondsouza Personally I think Utd should just tell Madrid, the deal is gone and then in January sell DDG to Barca
638627645425623040	barca	1	Barca may have the best players, but they are miles away from having the best team. Look at that shit def. #barca https://t.co/N3uFl2XIam
638637717509799936	barca	0	Barca fans when they saw "UEFA will study the case tomorrow. They will make a decision on the De Gea case" http://t.co/BmV0wbjeoy
638641315719286784	barca	2	@ChampionsLeague @FCBarcelona barca will successfully defended the title, with the arda and aleix in January plus MSN I don't see them lose.
638657552495038464	barca	0	@tigeramer10 @SergeMUFC .. Which they won't do as they are facing a transfer ban akin to Barca. Even De Gea going January misses the CL.
638661416422129664	barca	1	He was in the Atletico academy, Real is the biggest team in Europe next to Barca. All his friends are in Madrid. LOL https://t.co/AiCHWLTiU8
638680730160115712	barca	-1	@AnderJuanderful when managers/players make it a matter of their ego then things always go bad. That's his problem.. 2nd stint at Barca e.g
638692297438314496	barca	0	Barca won the treble and had a transfer ban yet they signed two players. Arsenal came 3rd in the BPL and they didn't buy an outfield player
638766156552249344	barca	0	@The__Fundraiser Barca turned down the opportunity and experimented with Suarez. Bayern haven't opened a cheque yet[Have 1st preference]
638771008615395328	barca	0	@RafaelH117 he's a fraud who will be gone by May. Bet you weren't saying this when he was at barca
638811135316242432	barca	1	@jamiepowell07 its the dogs, ye its amazing and defo go to a barca game, the 1st footie game ive enjoyed in years
638817591385980928	barca	0	Ben Lederman may well end up being the first American to play for Barca but, for the time being, it sounds like he's heading to Florida.
638842021675991041	barca	2	Definitely Liverpool's anthem is the best, 2nd is Barca's one, love it!
638848188548452353	barca	1	@THE_RAJ14 he should come out in press now. And may be sign for Barca or City. :D
638982574631579649	barca	1	Then everton will get the player from Barca on loan :) https://t.co/n1vOyCdFiy
638987354703855616	barca	1	@bluekippercom @edmunddafox he's off to barca in January
639032600586289152	barca	1	@Guinnessvip Equally he's d 2nd most expensive under21s(after Neymar's Barca move)&amp;3rd most expensive signing in ManU's history #MadeOfBlack
639041704436305921	barca	0	Atletico Madrid is going to be dangerous..Pedro leaving is going to hurt Barca in the long run..no bench to rest MSN https://t.co/TD02TABov8

639133841496645633	barca	1	@jack_blackwell @Jeinnylizarazo here's the thing if you put barca and Madrid in the epl it would be exactly the same in la liga barca 1st
639155392853975040	barca	1	@namorbassi loooool phones a myth. In Venice today, going to Nice in the morning then going Barca on saturday for a week. Also send money

640319900343398400	barca	1	@tfaheel haha no, the first was just Barca and then I put the "|" just to separate for my 2nd club
640379349368070144	barca	1	@hotcheetos4 still got smacked by Barca. Wolfsburg went far in the Europa and BVB lost to finalists. EPL is 3rd.
640428065835876352	barca	1	Fifa sunday! @LezzD PSG or Barca all the way @goitsemakwati
640468761439567872	barca	1	The Tenerife vs. Barca Femeni game has commenced. Jenni Hermoso scored for Barca in the 5th minute. Tenerife 0-1 Barca. #FCBLive
640500462408605697	barca	1	Barca beats Joventut 86-77 in 1st preseason game. Marc Garcia and Demond Mallet led all scorers with 20 points each
640520360627163136	barca	1	@haidar_altaie @FootyQuestions1 Exactly. Only reason Torres even came back into the lime-light were for 1st minute goals vs Madrid &amp; Barca
640537082801319936	barca	1	@BespokeBarware boo hoo... In Barca at the moment! The bar doesn't open Sunday and Monday's! Go home Tuesday. #tikisad
640566901991710722	barca	0	Arda Turan got cramp, I am not surprised! Sign for Barca but can't play til January, what do you expect lol
640576345358106624	barca	1	@Hayles_101 the chap is in his 2nd season of a 3 year deal. He has done the business at barca and Munich and I'm sure he will do it for us.
640576800071000064	barca	1	@christhomas1190 he'll be ready in January for Barca!!
640580666040520704	barca	1	@andrewmperry the thing though is if pogba ever does leave juve it will be to barca, also my team isn't in 13th place right now.
640666824774782976	barca	1	Can't wait for Arda to play with Barca, January na pls! https://t.co/RWRRFgDnf0
640830613109534722	barca	1	@Oo_Gho_Gho So Neymar being fifth and Eden being 6th shows nothing other than Barca did better than chelsea in the CL.
640857616730615808	barca	0	We are not Real Barca or Bayern that players would be ready to join the club as a 2nd/ 3rd choice. On what grounds would you bench Coq/Santi
640859852655431680	barca	1	@Kayboy_007 he should walk straight to barca's 1st team.
640897834418618368	barca	1	Slowly getting my last bits pulled together for Barca! Gonna get everything finalised today so I can just relax tomorrow :)
641188634763378688	barca	0	Neymar was always gonna be something special. I honestly hate his role at Barca, he might be good, but he has to play 2nd fiddle to Messi
641217303040892928	barca	1	@FFC_JM @adidasUK may all the power of Barca and Messi be with you this season!
641449533201756160	barca	1	Neymar shockingly starts playing for Brazil like he does for Barca https://t.co/RSuKe3s16i
641469594247413761	barca	0	I hated Tata Martino in Barca and I can't stand him coaching Argentina! Even though it's a friendly no reason to play 5 defenders in 1st 45
641518637707325440	barca	1	@EhabIbrahim77 Man Utd are a bigger club than everyone besides Real and Barca. They may be at the top of their game by the time he peaks
641518786344960000	barca	0	Barca want midfielder, forward in January http://t.co/aYwD4sNFpm
641562317528809476	barca	1	@MoeAnabtawi Barca is the best team not Real .. no one can win over it ... and see u on Sat ;)

635513280988061696	federer	1	Some outrageous shots from Federer in the tiebreak. The clean half volley return of a Djokovic 2nd serve just about the best of them.

636936698144821248	federer	1	@ViVi_RFObsessed Looks clear cut for Federer though. But 3 sets may be a critical   variable when he plays against Stan or Murray
637082749875134464	federer	1	All though Federer will probably obliterate the 4th quarter I think Gasquet 200/1 looks big #usopen
637492541969928192	federer	1	@livetennis I believe Federer has a good chance of winning the title for the 6th time but he needs to hold his composer against djokovic!

639589478638743552	federer	1	Darcis stops the bleeding by winning his 1st game since 1-0 in the first serve. Well, one kind of bleeding because Federer's still leading.
639599584252166144	federer	1	Federer is about to be done with his match in the same time the 5th set of the Hewitt vs. Tomic match takes!

640149748763217920	federer	0	Fognini is I believe only the 3rd one to beat Nadal 3 or more times in a year - the others (no points for guessing) Federer and Djokovic.
640210392829042688	federer	1	Most Masters 1000 titles (27) 2nd most Grand Slam titles (24 tied with Sampras after Federer's 17)
640212019833085952	federer	2	Federer breaks the Kohlschreiber serve!! Federer is on red hot form &amp; doesnt look like stopping. Fed leads 2-0 in the 1st set #USOpen
640213184088010752	federer	1	Good starts for Federer and Stosur. Berdych level at 1-1 after winning the 2nd set!
640227149438390273	federer	0	Wow, tragic start from Federer in the 3rd
640227987342934016	federer	1	Just like in the 2nd, Federer breaks back.
640233756511440896	federer	0	Just got to watch Federer win 4 consecutive points to get the decisive break in the 3rd set before mom snatched the remote citing god!
640234141431275521	federer	1	Roger while having trouble with serve, he is still through to 4th round! Federer might face Isner in 4th round
640234182384480256	federer	1	5 time @usopen champion Federer defeats 29th seed Kohlschreiber and he's through to the last 16 to play 13th seed Isner or Vesely! #USOpen
640234912025448448	federer	1	Federer is through to his 15th straight 4th round at the US Open. He's 8-4 with two other wins by walkover. http://t.co/p36dNjyxkV
640235978569838592	federer	0	Shriver to Federer suggesting that he not use the SABR vs. Isner "You want to have your 3rd set of twins I'm sure."  Interview ended there.
640245789311172608	federer	0	@JohnIsner I concur with your coach. Its you! #AmexTennis Good luck tomorrow against Federer!
640249529510547456	federer	1	Federer is gonna be playing in the championship on the first sunday of the nfl season. Tough decisions

640270623516717056	federer	0	Federer's next match is going to be the 1st obstacle he faces on his way to the finals. His first serve needs to be on point against Isner.
640360671054557184	federer	0	Survey: Federer has ostensibly the toughest 4th round match, but is there a tougher one? Does Isner win a set? Does RBA?
640426974645620736	federer	1	Federer advances into fourth round at US Open: In the blazing New York sun, Federer seems to be in his element... http://t.co/CoiDuhKlL4

641066878375493633	federer	1	Federer's second serve placement is awesome. That's why he's the best server ever. Nobody has better placement on 1st or 2nd serve
641067646608371712	federer	1	Gonna have to DVR this Isner and Federer match... This thing is good. Getting ready to head to a tiebreaker in the 1st set. #USOpen2015
641074875982028800	federer	1	Federer saved 4 BP (from 0/40) and holds for 2-2 in the 2nd set.
641082313938305024	federer	0	'Sneak Attack By Roger' (SABR) causing errors this game for Federer. May be it's Isner's height #USOpen2015
641084956274466816	federer	0	Ok time to check back in with tennis - Isner and Federer heading into a 2nd tiebreak
641085537973997568	federer	2	Federer just ended the 2nd set with a couple of ridiculously good shots.
641085618169245700	federer	2	Federer rebounds from 3-5 down in the 2nd set tb to take it 8-6. Leads Isner. 7-6(0) 7-6(6) #usopen
641087405353779200	federer	1	I watched Federer calmly destroy a dude at the US Open on Thursday, and it was amazing. I still thought "you're not sick of this dude yet?"
641088714014347264	federer	1	I believe the loss at RG to Wawrinka was first time in a decade Federer didn't break once in a GS match. This might be the 2nd. #USOpen2015
641089660849127424	federer	1	That ending of 2nd set TB by Federer, he really is the original son of Jor-el
641094016289914880	federer	1	Wow, Federer wastes 3 bps with 3 Isner's 2nd serves. Fed 0/8 on bps tonight
641096525980938240	federer	2	Federer's 1st serve is just...perfect. #USOpen
641096620172382208	federer	1	Federer just won his 15th straight point on his serve... Lol wow
641097239696293888	federer	1	In French Open QF, Federer didn't break serve -- 1st time in Slam match in 13 years. Tonight he breaks for 1st time in his last return game.
641097789565353985	federer	-1	i out of 11 breakpts converted-not nearly good enough by Federer at #USOpen2015 . C'mon, Deliciano, you can beat Novak- Believe !
641099162243698688	federer	0	Disappointing end to the match for Isner. Would've liked to see a 3rd set tiebreak but Federer is a robot. He's ridiculous.
641110299576258561	federer	1	@NerdistMom It's weird that in the 1st set Federer &amp; Isner went game for game until the tiebreak. Then Federer trucked him in the tiebreak
641127726192177152	federer	1	Federer breaks his own record with a 14th appearance at the ATP Finals after reaching the US QF #FinalShowdown http://t.co/ugI3PQBp8w
641207353660960768	federer	2	With his consistency in playing great tennis, i am sure Federer will crush Gasquet in the QF. C'mon Federer!! http://t.co/LHCEhZo26g

641408835064864768	harper	-1	@ThomasMulcair Thomas, you must use this against Harper even if it did come from Ignatieff.  http://t.co/9dlTXt8Fy5
641424242379239424	harper	0	Harper was right lol, Nats leave in the 7th
641424442019708928	harper	-1	@ZuckermanCSN I hope someone asks Harper why the team bailed in the 7th inning
641425903755640832	harper	1	Big spot for Harper now in the 7th to impress the fans left in the park
641426519064211456	harper	-1	Shame all the fans that stuck around to see a six run lead blown and Harper make an out for the 8th time in two games. #Nationals
641426565151240192	harper	-1	Harper may never get a hit against the Mets the rest of his career #LGM
641432412040364032	harper	0	@dcsportsbog Harper misspoke yesterday. The brutality in the 7th was on the field. Same as tonight. #nats
641432981916229632	harper	1	@maryb889 Still have the 9th &amp; top of order!  Harper walkoff homer!
641434130727706624	harper	0	OK, last chance for the #Nats. It's Werth, Rendon, Harper vs. Familia in 9th, down 8-7.
641434709948530688	harper	1	Werth, Rendon, and Harper due up in the bottom of the 9th, #Nats trail Mets 8-7.
641434958691717120	harper	-2	I hope all the fans stayed into the 9th to watch Harper go 0-5. #nats
641435452847845376	harper	1	He's bunting!? That leaves 1st open to walk Harper and set up the DP
641436233089032192	harper	1	#Nats Rendon bunts but Werth is erased at 2nd. Runner on 1st with 1 out.  Harper at bat...
641436951090827264	harper	0	Harper walks. #Nats now have two men on with one out. Escobar will bat next. Still 8-7 Mets in the bottom of the 9th.
641437332118351872	harper	0	@TedStarkey even a successful bunt puts us right they are now 1st and 2nd 1 out after the IBB to Harper. So dumb.

641445679471198208	harper	-1	@KennyHerzog In this series the Nationals may have lost the division and Harper may have lost the MVP.

641600711482937344	harper	1	@SBNationMLB @SBNation The idea that the Mets would have walked Harper if it was 1st/2nd no outs in lunacy.
