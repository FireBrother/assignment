639135979480215552	nintendo	negative	1st party Nintendo games stay stupidly expensive. Why is Mario Party 9 still $44.99 most places? Definitely not the "QUALITY" of the titles.
639142132817641472	nintendo	positive	@DanteReborn I honestly think the Super Mario Bros 2 set is coming.  Nintendo wanted to concentrate development on the more-similar sets 1st

639798156079665154	nintendo	positive	On 2nd thought, the NX rumors don't completely make sense because Nintendo is already planning smartphone games
639921099166339072	nintendo	positive	@jrconway3 @BitnerdGX Sure, it may not be in a direct sense. But Nintendo gives GX the support by sending them coverage and press releases.
640012708411129856	nintendo	negative	I admit Nintendo may have gone a bit overboard with the whole "lets give all the popular youtubers a copy of super mario maker" thing

640523838321725444	nintendo	positive	@ZeroSHEARER @ZhugeEX again an improvement. I don't like barely any Nintendo first party exclusives. It's ALL about 3rd party on all systems
640624064198017024	nintendo	positive	@THEREALRTU but then I suppose the 3rd party ports suffer ,maybe Nintendo will use nvidia for there gfx chip... Lol

641295492492738560	nintendo	positive	@JediPrince84 I bought Rayman Legends just to have some simple fun. I can't wait for Nintendo to sink and become a 2nd/3rd party developer
641296016788996096	nintendo	positive	It would be poetic if Nintendo became a Sony 2nd Party Developer. It would also make choosing consoles every generation very easy
641296390883291136	nintendo	positive	Apparently Super Mario Maker comes out on the 11th of September. I guess it's Nintendo's way of saying "just bloody rebuild them already".
